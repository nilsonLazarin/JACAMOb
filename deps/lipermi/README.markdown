LipeRMI
=======

LipeRMI is a light-weight RMI implementation for Java. I decided to fork it from
the original author as it has not been maintained for 3 years, and there were
some changes I wanted to make.

The original project can be found here:

 * http://lipermi.sourceforge.net
 * http://www.sourceforge.net/project/lipermi

My interest in this project is as an RMI solution for Android. There is no
java.rmi on Android, and porting it is cumbersome. LipeRMI has no dependencies
outside of core Java (and all of them are satisfied under Dalvik) and is a very
small code-base.
