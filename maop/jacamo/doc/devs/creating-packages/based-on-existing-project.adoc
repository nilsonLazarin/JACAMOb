= What You Will Build

This document describes the steps to create a JaCaMo Package from an *existing* project.

For more general information about packages, see xref:./index.adoc[this doc].

= What You Need

* Java 17 or newer
* *JaCaMo >= 1.2*
* A JaCaMo application 
**  hosted on GitHub
** with `build.gradle`. If your application hasn't a gradle script, copy one from  https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/blob/packages/src/main/resources/templates/build.gradle[here] and replace `<...>` by suitable values.

= Configuring the Gradle Script

Your project should build a jar file with all package components (.asl files, classes, ...). JaCaMo applications created after version  1.2 have the following task in the `build.gradle` for that:

----
jar {
    duplicatesStrategy 'exclude'

    archiveBaseName = project.name

    from (project.projectDir.absolutePath + '/src') {
        include '**/*.asl'
        include '**/*.xml'
        include '**/*.sai'
        include '**/*.ptl'
        include '**/*.jcm'
        exclude 'test'
    }
    from (project.buildDir.absolutePath + '/classes') {
        include '**/*'
    }
}
----

Your `build.gradle` file should also have:

----
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
----

and

----
publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication) {
            from components.java
        }
    }
}
----

The `group` in `build.gradle` should be set accordingly. For instance:

----
group = 'com.github.jomifred'
----

Your package will be *identified* by three parts: 

[.text-center]
<group>:<projec name>:<version>.


NOTE: you find an example of `build.gradle` https://github.com/jomifred/jcm-hello/blob/main/build.gradle[here].

When your `build.gradle` is edited, commit the changes on GitHub.


= Publication on GitHub

Then go to your GitHub account and create a *release* (for instance, named `1.0` based on tag `1.0`).

= Using the package

Users of your package should change their `build.gradle` and `.jcm` files. 

The `build.gradle` file should include JitPack in the list of repositories. JitPack is responsible for 'placing' your project from GitHub into a maven repository. 

.build.gradle
----
...
repositories {
    ...
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation('org.jacamo:jacamo:1.2')

    implementation('<package identifier>')    
}
----

NOTE: JaCaMo 1.2 creates Gradle files as above. So no need to  edit `build.gradle` for JaCaMo applications >= 1.2.

If your package includes `.asl` files, the `.jcm` should add an _alias_ for the package identification.

.user application jcm file
----
mas xxx {

    ....

    uses package: <alias> "<package identifier>"

}
----

`<package identifier>` is something like `com.github.jomifred:jcm-hello:1.0` and `<alias>` is a word that will be used to include `.asl` files from your package into the user application. 

The syntax for includes is:

----
{ include("$<alias>/<some package file>.asl") }
----

For instance:
----
{ include("$hello/agt/hello-grid.asl") }
----
where `hello` is the alias for the package `com.github.jomifred:jcm-hello:1.0`.

When the application is executed

1. gradle will ask JitPack for the package;
1. JitPack will build the package (downloading a release of your project and running `./gradlew`); 
1. gradle places the package (as a .jar file) in the classpath when running the user application. 

So all classes from the package are handled as usual in gradle applications. 

It is useful to look at the URL https://jitpack.io/com/github/jomifred/jcm-hello/1.0/build.log (replacing group, package and version) to see the result of building the package from GitHub (step 2 above).
