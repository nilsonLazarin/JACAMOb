:toc: right

== Installation

*outdated* see xref:../../install.adoc[install] instead.

. Download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here] and unzip it.

. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JDK_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory)

== Development

. Create a new project with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And run it with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm



You can also run it using https://gradle.org[Gradle]:

    cd ../somewhere/helloworld
    ./gradlew -q


If you use the https://atom.io[Atom] editor, the following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].
